	<p class="movieDetail">Comedy ain’t pretty. And it sure ain’t nice. Keep that in mind while watching director Jason Reitman’s (Juno, Ghostbusters: Afterlife) breathless ode to working with creative iconoclasts, the bull-headed first cast of “SNL” comedians who were so certain that they were onto something fresh and funny, that they would steamroll their own mothers for getting in their way. Reitman doesn’t go for the sentimental when dramatizing what it’s like to stalk the halls of 30 Rock in those final 90 minutes before the first showtime, and that’s the perfect choice. The film and the now 50-year-running sketch comedy titan want to capture that feeling of creative spark, then keep moving onto the next sketch, the next season, the next cast, the next decade, and never allow themselves to bask in the beauty of their own accomplishments, because where’s the humor in that?
